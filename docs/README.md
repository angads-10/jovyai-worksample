## üéØ Key Concepts

### Decision Transformer
A transformer-based approach to offline reinforcement learning that models sequential decision-making as a sequence modeling problem.

### Offline RL
Reinforcement learning from pre-collected data without online interaction with the environment.

### Healthcare Applications
Medical decision-making using patient trajectory data, with emphasis on safety and interpretability.

### Safety Monitoring
Built-in mechanisms to detect and prevent unsafe actions in medical contexts.
